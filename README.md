# Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews

This project analyzes customer reviews to classify them as positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative based on their text content.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming text data for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis: Visualizing sentiment distribution and common words with word clouds.
- Feature extraction: Using Bag of Words (BoW) to convert text into numerical features.
- Model building: Training and evaluating multiple classifiers â€” Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression.
- Model evaluation: Comparing performance metrics and confusion matrices to select the best model.
- Sentiment lexicon approach: Applying VADER sentiment analyzer to compare lexicon-based results with ML models.  

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- NLTK (Stopwords, Lemmatizer, VADER)
- WordCloud for visualization
- Scikit-learn (CountVectorizer, Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression)
